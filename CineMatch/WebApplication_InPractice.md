<!--
Some use cases for both HTTPS and JSON:

HTTPS:

-   Any situation where sensitive data is being transmitted over the internet, such as login credentials, payment information, or personal data.
-   Any situation where the data being transmitted needs to be kept confidential and secure, such as in a healthcare application.
-   Any situation where the integrity and authenticity of the data being transmitted needs to be ensured, such as in an online banking application.

JSON:

-   Any situation where structured data needs to be exchanged between systems or applications, such as in a REST API.
-   Any situation where the data being transmitted needs to be lightweight and easily parsable, such as in a mobile app or web application.
-   Any situation where the data being transmitted needs to be easily readable and editable by developers, such as in a configuration file.

<!-- ### Info for later

Storing only the essential information in your local database will reduce storage requirements and minimize redundancy. When a user requests more detailed information about a movie, you can make a request to the API to fetch that information and display it to the user. This way, you can ensure that your database remains lightweight and only contains the necessary information.

# 6. User Experience

The biggest challenge with coming up with a design was to incorporate both Matching applications like Tinder and Cinema aesthetics.
