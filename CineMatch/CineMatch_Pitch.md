# CineMatch - Pitch

# What?

CineMatch is a software project that allows users to plan a visit to a certain movie, within a certain timeslot and location. When submitted, the idea behind this is that they can get matched with other users that have a matching movie (genre), timeslot or location. Once a match has been found, users can communicate through the application and leave a review about their overall experience afterwards.

While this project shares a few traits with popular dating apps like Tinder, the intend is different.

# Why?

The need for a ‘buddy’ to do activities with is high nowadays. Especially after COVID-19, people are struggling to be more social and finding an activity within a shared interest can be hard. CineMatch is an initiative that aims to help people be more social and taking ‘the first steps’ to getting in touch with new people. Eventually, this project might expand to be more than just the cinema.

There are currently no (popular) projects like this, except for a few that have a broad range of activities and not just a cinema visit. This might give users the opportunity to have an app to go to, a central place, when they do not want to be by themselves in the cinema.

# How?

Taking Tinder as an inspiration when it comes to tech stacks, I mainly want to make sure this project checks all the relevant learning outcomes. I will be exploring new concepts like React for the frontend part and Java for the backend. For asynchronous communication and concurrency, I hope to implement a chat functionality for users.
