## 1. Project Description
CineMatch is a software project that allows users to plan a visit to a certain movie, within a certain timeslot and location and let the software find a match with another user that has scheduled for a matching or similar movie (genre), timeslot or location. Once a match has been made, users can communicate through the application to decide on further details and leave a review about their overall experience afterwards. 
While similar in some respects to popular dating apps, such as Tinder, CineMatch is intended to serve a different purpose.

The need for a ‘buddy’ to do activities with is high nowadays. Especially after COVID-19, people are struggling to be more social and finding an activity within a shared interest can be hard. This initiative seeks to alleviate social isolation and encourage social interaction by enabling users to connect with others interested in going to the movies. There are currently no (popular) projects like this, except for a few that have a broad range of activities and not just a cinema visit. This might give users the opportunity to have an app to go to, a central place, when they do not want to be by themselves in the cinema. The project's ultimate goal is to expand beyond the cinema and encompass a broader range of activities.

## 5. Test Methodologies
In addition to the project analysis outlining the design choices and requirements of our software application, there is a separate document that covers our test methodologies. This document details the various testing approaches we are utilizing throughout the software development lifecycle, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. It also describes the specific tools and frameworks we are using to automate our testing processes and ensure the quality and reliability of our software product. By following these rigorous testing procedures, we hope to deliver a high-performing, bug-free application that meets the needs and expectations of our stakeholders.
