# VoiceCheck - Pitch

# What?

VoiceCheck is an initiative based on the vast growing world of voice actors and actresses. Voice acting is mostly found in media such as movies, animations, video games and even voice overs for documentaries belong to the genre. Companies are always on the lookout for voice talents, even if it concerns a simply “how-to” video. VoiceCheck aims to provide a platform for enthusiastic newcomers in the field to make their debut and find helpful resources in one place. In addition to that, companies looking for voice talents should be able to access new content and connect with those actors. Finally, we hope to welcome actual experts of the subject in the future so there can be a dedicated place for everything related to voice acting.

# Why?

Because of the increasing popularity and interest in voice acting, voice clips of beginners pursuing their passion hoping to make it big and requests for voices are found all over the internet, but there is no central place for either party. Besides that, resources are similarly scattered across the internet. By providing a central place including the most up-to-date resources, discussions, and voice requests, both parties might be able to be satisfied much sooner.
