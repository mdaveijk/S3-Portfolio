# **1. Introduction**

Welcome to my portfolio for S3-DB01 (Spring, 2023). 
This document serves as the reader's guide to my portfolio items of
S3-DB01 (Spring, 2023). For the reader's guide of the previous S3 semester (Fall, 2022) where I mainly focussed on the GPS, please click **[here](GP/ReadersGuidePortfolio_MauriceSchippers_v2_0.pdf)**.

This portfolio is organized into two main sections: The IPS and the GPS section. 
The first section is the IPS section, which contains all of the work I have completed during **this** semester. Each subsection includes a link to the created work, an explanation of how it relates to the learning outcomes (LOs), and notes on any overlapping information regarding LOs. Additionally, if relevant, a link to work from the previous semester is provided.
The second section is the GPS section, which contains all the LOs related to the GPS and the links to the work I did for them in the previous semester. 
The final section includes my overall reflection on the semester. This section is divided into subsections, where I look back upon what went well, what could have gone better and decide on what my next steps will be.

Please note that bold and underlined text indicates a clickable link.

### **Web application (LO1)**
## Work

Web Application is a broad learning outcome which concerns the different
aspects of working **full stack**, **SQL vs NoSQL,** **asynchronous
communication** and **user experience**. The (zipped) source code from
my frontend and backend projects (**IPS**) can be found in the folder:
[LO1_WebApplication]{.underline}. I worked on this until the decision
was made to split the semester. There is another document alongside
these zip folders showing everything I have done for this learning
outcome, both **IPS & GPS**, which you can read here:
[LO1_WebApplication\\WebApplication_InPractice.pdf].

*Self-rating*

I am glad I decided to switch between stacks during the semester, I
learned a lot by doing so. It turns out that the more I worked on small
parts and together with other students, the more I enjoyed it and
learned quicker. One rememberable thing I want to mention here is that
at the end of the semester, I finished a small data table in JavaScript
in less than an hour. For me, this was the key point of process: I
started out with no knowledge of the language and I finished the
semester by making (small) components in little time. Long story short:
I am especially happy about my (fast) learning process, I think the
document mentioned in **[Work]{.underline}** is the best proof of that.

It took some time for me to adapt during the semester, I did not start
out with the current mindset that I have now. During the first two
sprints, I wasted too much time on getting things to work (like setting
up Java or getting Python to work) instead of moving on to other things,
which eventually lead to me not being able to try out other things (like
with my JavaScript framework research). This caused more delay in my
planning than necessary. I also do not feel like I have shown my
proficiency towards UX as well as I had hoped to, whilst I do feel like
I have sufficient knowledge about it.

## Next steps

To mitigate the chances of more delay in the future, some of the things
I have been doing is ask around for help, start from scratch or move
onto other tasks. I started this after the first assessment and it has
improved my study and planning by a mile.

I want to practice with the other frameworks more in the future now that
I have gained some experience with JavaScript. I even feel confident
enough in taking on the challenge of using TypeScript. In addition, I
hope to show more UX in my next project and perform more usability tests
as they are very interesting and I learn a lot from observing users.

# **Agile method (LO3)**

## Work

As of version 1.1, there are currently two documents that concern this
learning outcome.

I started my research on Scrum quite early in the semester and
immediately implemented the results in the group project. My research
features a summary of the foundation of agile, a list of the most common
agile frameworks, a detailed explanation of the Scrum process and more.
My research is documented here: [LO3_AgileMethod/AgileMethods_Research]

I feel confident that I applied Scrum correctly in GPS. This feeling is
mostly based on the feedback I have received from the other members
during the semester. The details of the implementation are found here:
[LO3_AgileMethod/AgileMethods_InPractice].

  -------------- -------------- -------------- -------------- --------------

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Self-rating*

I am happy about the work I did for this learning outcome. I feel like I
am proficient because I can talk and explain several different aspects
of the topic. I also learned a lot, even things to apply to my general
way of working: I found out that one of the best ways to deal with
perfectionism is by working agile; sort of being forced to only do a
certain amount of work (and touch upon every part of the software
develop process cycle) within a limited time span. This is something I
want to keep with me when I work on any project from now on. I also
learned how to work with agile tools correctly and most importantly, how
they improve the process and why they make a difference. I will be
working with Jira a lot from now on.

I noticed that it can be hard sometimes to maintain the subject at hand
during meetings when we slowly stray away from the subject and start
talking about other, less relevant topics. This also resulted in not
being able to implement and follow through with fixed agenda points,
like updating our Jira board. Which eventually lead to us not being able
to work with a burndown chart, something I would have liked to use and
possibly might have motivated the other members too.

## Next steps

If there is one thing I have learned about Agile, it is that the
learning and polishing never stops. Agile is meant to improve a product
over time in an efficient way and eventually create a product close to
what a product owner really wants. But where we improve our product, we
improve ourselves by constantly looking back on the process. No matter
what role I will have in the next project, I will try to keep on
'polishing myself' by listening to others, reading (like the books
"Clean Code" & "The Pragmatic Programmer") and contributing my ideas to
the projects yet to come. Additionally, I hope to try out other roles
within the Scrum team too. This is, in my opinion, the only way to truly
understand a role or process.

# **Cultural differences and ethics (LO5)**

## Work

For this learning outcome, I created one general document where I
discuss ethical principles and real-life examples where they might be
relevant. I also talk about cultural situations (like working in group
projects with members from other countries/cultures) and did a small
interview with a teacher who is part of the "Global Acting Group" within
Fontys. More about it here:
[LO5_Cultural_differences_and_ethics\\Cultural_Differences_and_ethics_Report.pdf]

I gave myself the "Proficient" rating (see **[Reflection]{.underline}**)
because I am always up for a talk about the subject; I enjoy listening
and sharing my visions with other people. On a more professional level,
I think I have sufficient knowledge on the topic to recognise what is
ethical and what is not and where the differences lie between cultural
and personal traits. In the document mentioned before, I talk a little
bit about how I work with other cultures.

One more interesting thought I wanted to share is that I think this
specific outcome relates to multiple other learning outcomes: Ethics
are, for example, to be considered when you are working on UX design
(LO1: Web Application), this is also discussed in the document above.
Ethics are also part of a business process (LO7: Business process): Are
the decisions we make ethical or not? Maybe it will improve business,
but how does it affect the users? Thinking about this matter can improve
a process significantly. While cultural differences are very important
to the learning outcomes LO3: Agile and LO8: Professional. How we
connect and interact with others are what makes us professionals and
Scrum aims to 'bond' the strengths of all the team members in order to
form a stronger team.

  -------------- -------------- -------------- -------------- --------------

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Self-rating*

I realised I really enjoy talking, writing, and researching about this
subject. This is also what motivated me to ask a teacher more about the
subject, especially since it concerns the university I attend. Most new
things I have learned were more on the ethics part of the learning
outcome. I think working on this subject made me more aware of how
important ethics are when it comes to creating new software and most
importantly, the consequences when they are not considered. I noticed
that this learning outcome is often seen as the least important, but I
personally think it might be one of the most important ones. In my
opinion, it is often the non-technical skills that matter the most in
the long run.

I started way too late on this subject, which lead to me not being able
to cover everything I wanted to talk about and making the document seem
a bit rushed. In hindsight, it might have been better to tackle the
cultural part of this learning outcome earlier in the semester; it might
have been a good experience to share with the other group members.
Speaking of which, if I had started working on this learning outcome
sooner, I would have been able to discuss the results from the tests I
have taken with the group, concerning my role in group projects. We
could have used these results to better determine positions within the
group and finding the strengths of other members, even affecting LO3:
Agile and LO8: Professional to a certain extend.

## Next steps

I have barely scratched the surface of the 'iceberg' of the ethics
topic. Like what I wrote in the (Agile) **[Next steps]{.underline}** I
believe the learning on this topic never stops. We are living in a vast
changing world and to keep up with the changes it is important to stay
informed. Therefore, I have decided to get more involved and spread more
awareness for ethical software. My first step was to do the interview
with somebody that is involved in a greater organisation almost
literally based on this learning outcome. I also want to read more books
about the subject, possibly starting with the before mentioned book
"Weapons of math destruction". Another individual who greatly inspired
me is Tristan Harris, Ex-Design Ethicist at Google. He has given
multiple TED-talks and interviews explaining why ethics are so important
in software. I want to see more and learn from him in the future.

# **Requirements and design (LO6)**

## Work

As of version 1.1, there is currently one document that concerns this
learning outcome.

### Sprint 1

I created the Project Analysis document which contains:

-   the C1 (Context) part of the C4-model that concerns the architecture
    of my application

-   user stories (which involve both functional and non-functional
    requirements)

This document can be found here:
[LO6_Requirements_and_design\\IP_VoiceCheck_Analysis.docx]

### Sprint 2

In sprint 2, I created one working (.NET core and Vue) and one-half
working (Quarkus works, React does not) prototype using different
technology stacks, to find the combination that best supports my
individual project. Please check the (LO1: Web Application)
**[Work]{.underline}** section for the related work.

  -------------- -------------- -------------- -------------- --------------

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Self-rating*

In sprint 1 I spent a lot of time on this Learning Outcome, looking for
fitting user stories and looking into a possible architecture while
mostly paying attention to what users might require. This went very
well, as I got good feedback on how I deepened myself into how a user
might possibly think. On the downside, I feel like I might have wasted
too much time in sprint 2 by playing around with technical stacks.
Looking back, this does not seem to be the best approach. I read the
pages about architecture on the GPS section about a week ago and
realised that my approach did not lead to any useful results. Besides
having a lot of trouble with setting up my first Java project (which
cost me a lot of time), I do not think it was worth wasting so much time
on when I had a working prototype in .NET core.

## Next steps

There is a lot of work to do on this Learning Outcome and I very much
underestimated it. However, I have a solid plan to try and get back into
it. Starting in sprint 3, I will be mapping the user stories to
components (as explained in the architecture page of the Canvas GPS
course) and group them by non-functional requirements. From there on,
closely follow the steps described there to build distributed software
system and simultaneously create the C2 and C3 levels of the C4 model.
When this is finished, I will complete the Quarkus -- React
architecture, write down and explain my decision for the chosen
technology stacks. I want to finally practice the microservice course
that I had planned for sprint 1, this could be useful for to gain
inspiration on further decisions. Lastly, I will be looking into tech
stacks of existing applications that resemble my idea and take
inspiration from them. If everything goes according to plan, I am hoping
to apply my newly gained knowledge to the group project as well and see
if our current project can improve.

# **Business processes (LO7)**

## Work

As of version 1.1, there is currently one document that concerns this
learning outcome.

###  Sprint 1

I worked on the process analysis for the group project during the
sprint 1. The document can be found here:
[LO7_BusinessProcesses/GP_ProcessAnalysis]

According to Marc, my GPS teacher, I am missing some aspects like the
history of the company. Additionally, I received the tip to make the
paper readable for future reading. The context should be clear, and
someone should be able to immediately tell what it is about.

  -------------- -------------- -------------- -------------- --------------

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Self-rating*

I am glad I started working on this learning outcome as soon as
possible. The PO also seemed pleasantly surprised to see the process
analysis so early in the project. However, as stated in the previous
section, it is missing a lot of valuable information that would make it
more accessible for future readers.

## Next steps

I have planned to complete this document in the last sprint of the
semester. By complete I mean that I will then add the remaining
information and ask for feedback again. By then, I expect the project to
be at a certain stage, so I will have to possible reflect this in the
paper as well.

# **Professional (LO8)**

## Work

As of version 2.0, I have this learning outcome covered for the most
part. I do not have proof, but I am familiar with the DOT framework and
could answer questions about how it works and how it is applied.

###  GPS

"*You develop software as a team effort according to a prescribed
software methodology and following team agreements. You are able to
track your work progress and communicate your progress with the team*."

We used Scrum as our method of choice and used Jira to monitor our work.
This part of the Learning Outcome: Professional is similar to what is
covered in the document "Agile: In Practice" under the section "Group
project". It can be found in this section of the reader:
**[Work]{.underline}**.

Another thing I think might have contributed to this learning outcome is
my way of providing peer feedback. Every sprint, I took the time to
write constructive feedback for my peers. As I am no longer able to see
them after I submitted the feedback, I do not really have any proof of
that. The only proof I can provide here is the feedback I received
during sprint 4.

![Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description

*Screenshot of Feedpulse. Retrospective sprint 4.*

Colleagues in a professional environment usually take several points
into consideration when writing peer reviews. When I write peer reviews,
I think about what my team members worked on during the sprint, how the
process went and other things that stood out during the sprint. If I
have any additional, reasonable advice, I add that as a suggestion at
the bottom, something they might look into. I think the goal should
always be to help another person or improve their performance, by
sharing my vision of their way of working. Feedback should always be
constructive.

*"You actively ask and apply feedback from stakeholders and advise them
on the most optimal technical and design (architectural) solutions.*

*You choose and substantiate solutions for a given problem."*

During the sprint reviews, we made sure to ask as much feedback as
possible and write everything down. After analysing the given feedback,
we determined whether follow-up questions or comments were necessary or
if it could be processed right away. Besides the contact moments during
the sprint reviews, we kept in touch through e-mail and made sure to add
the PO to our agile tool, Jira, to view the process we made.

Before going through with any major decisions, we made sure to discuss
our solutions with the PO. A good example of this is during sprint 3,
when the requests sent out by our application got blocked by websites.
We then made a top 3 list featuring pros and cons of external sources
that we might need to allow our application to get past this problem.
The PO then decided which ones were reasonable and which ones were not.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Self-rating*

I am satisfied but uncertain whether my work for this LO was sufficient.
My own work progress can be monitored, and my team members are always up
to date with what I am working on. I think I implemented and followed
the Scrum rules the right way, especially since all agreements were made
with the entire team involved. Regardless, I think I understand the
purpose of working with a software methodology and why it improves the
process. As fluent as it went during this semester, is something I could
only hope to experience many times from now on. But that is exactly what
I have learned: How working with a software methodology contributes to a
better working environment. In addition, something that I am especially
happy about, is that I learned how to write professional peer reviews.
By doing that every sprint, I got better and more to the point. These
are both skills that I need and will be using in the future.

Not everything went well for this learning outcome; as mentioned in the
(Agile) **[Reflection]{.underline}** section, not everyone in the team
used Jira optimally, which sometimes lead to confusion about what
everyone was working on. Besides that, it took a long time before the PO
was added to the Jira board. Several members sent e-mails to the PO as
we did not really have a fixed member in charge of contact. There is
also a lack of explanation and involvement for the choices we have made.
Finally, I am missing the proof for the connection between agile
development and software architecture / design choices. I should have
spent more time reading the requirements for this LO, especially the
Canvas page about agile development and software architecture.[^1]

## Next steps

I feel like I am on the right track to becoming a professional, but I
still have a long way to go. The path I am taking from here is focussing
on the connection between agile development and software architecture. I
want to be confident in the part of this LO: "to be able to advise them
on the most optimal technical and design choices". A good starting point
will be the before mentioned Canvas page but also the books I bought
during this semester: "Clean Code" & "The Pragmatic Programmer". So far,
it seems especially the latter will be contributing to this learning
outcome.

# **Reflection**

As of version 2.0, the section below contains an overall reflection of
the semester instead of a reflection per sprint.

*Self-rating*

### What went well

I made some big steps since the first assessment: I took a prominent
part in the group project, was able to present to the client and learned
a lot from working in the different tech stacks, which allowed me to
contribute a lot to the group project. I was told that the group members
started out with little faith in me when they heard I would be part of
their group (because I work remotely all the time), but during the last
retrospective they told me they were very glad to have me be part of
their team and barely noticed the difference. I am also happy with the
document I wrote for **[Web application (LO1)]{.underline}**, because it
is minimalistic, to the point and still contains all the relevant
information. It is an improvement from the way I designed the agile
documents, as I went from overcomplicated and losing sight of the scope,
to almost the complete opposite. I was able to show my progress by
writing two detailed reports.

### What could have gone better

The unfortunate part is that I realised how to take the 'right' approach
way too late (two weeks before the final assessment). I was not able to
update all the learning outcomes for the final assessment. I should have
delivered my portfolio more often and as stated in the Canvas section,
start in week 1. I do not think it was because I underestimated the work
that went into the learning outcomes, rather it was the feeling of being
overwhelmed all the time. It is a combination of my physical condition
and not knowing where to start or losing sight of the scope. Which in
hindsight, is simply a matter of asking for help or asking more
questions. I noticed that this is a common theme throughout all the
other reflections in this document and I have decided I need to do
something about it.

### Next steps

I have identified the problem I experience when I lose sight of the
scope and I am learning how to deal with it, like making only small
parts of a document or perform small tasks to get into the workflow.
Another thing I have been working on is finding and setting the 'right'
priorities to work on, to avoid having work left unfinished when I am
unable to work.

I am preparing myself for the IPS part of next semester. Armed with
sufficient knowledge of agile to prevent myself from spending too much
time on details, a great tool for planning my project (Jira) and a new
way of working: Do research, follow a dedicated tutorial or demo and
finally, implement it into my project. I feel much more confident going
into the semester for a second time. If things do not work out, I will
keep trying and set a timer to prevent getting completely lost in a
task. I will also reach out for help and if help is not available, I
will move onto another task. This is a mindset that I have since the
last assessment, and it did make a big difference for the process I
made. I will also deliver my work more often from now on, to keep a
clear idea of what needs to be done.
